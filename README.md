## Description

The task is to create a simple REST application from scratch. To reduce implementation time, please use the NestJS framework (this is a MUST, donâ€™t use any other framework). The application should implement a nodeJS server API communicating with this: https://reqres.in/

Use prerequisites below:
- use TypeScript 3.4 and above. 
- use NestJS Framework, https://docs.nestjs.com/ 
- use MongoDB 4.4 and above 
- use RabbitMQ 3.7 and above

The REST app should consist of:

- POST /api/users
On the request store the user entry in db. After the creation, send an email and rabbit event. Both can be dummy sending (no consumer needed).

- GET /api/user/{userId}
Retrieves data from https://reqres.in/api/users/{userId} and returns a user in JSON representation.

- GET /api/user/{userId}/avatar
Retrieves image by 'avatar' URL.
On the first request it should save the image as a plain file, stored as a mongodb entry with userId and hash. Return its base64-encoded representation.
On following requests should return the previously saved file in base64-encoded. representation (retrieve from db).

- DELETE /api/user/{userId}/avatar
Removes the file from the FileSystem storage.
Removes the stored entry from db.

### Delivery

The project builds and can start
All endpoints can be requested from postman
